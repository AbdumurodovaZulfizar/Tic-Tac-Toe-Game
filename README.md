# Tic Tac Toe 👇
## Welcome to Zulfizar and Angel's interesting game 🙌
## Game description
**Tic-tac-toe** (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English and British English), or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies” (Ireland), is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.<br>
1. Number of players 🙍‍♂️🙎🏻‍♀️: 2
2. Set up time ⏱: minimal
3. Playing time ⏱: ~1 minute
4. Skill(s) required 💪: Strategy, tactics, observation
5. Symbols ⭕️❌:	Noughts and crosses (Xs and Os)
6. Each player should select the number from the board! (only numbers from 1 to 9!)

In order to win the game, a player must place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

The following example game is won by the second player, O:

Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is most often played by young children, who often have not yet discovered the optimal strategy.
